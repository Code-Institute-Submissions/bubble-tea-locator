### Bugs ###
The stickmen logo that appear after pressing the men logo will change if the current location of the user change. 
So, their chances that another stick men might appear due to short shift in current location. 
At the same time, if the website could not detect the user current location even after enabling current location the enable your location message will appear. 
This is due to not able to detect your current location.
